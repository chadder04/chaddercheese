ChadderCheese
=====================

Personal website used as a foundation to learn everything I have come to love about web design. ChadderCheese was a personal photo gallery type website where users could sign up, create their own profile, add their own photos, send messages to other users, comment on other users photos, etc. 

This project was created using Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, HTML/CSS and PHP/MySQL
